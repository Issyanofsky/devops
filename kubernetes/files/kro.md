A Kubernetes Resource Orchestrator is a tool that manages and organizes the resources (like containers, networks, and storage) used by applications in a Kubernetes cluster. 

Kubernetes Resource Orchestrator (like the default Kubernetes control plane) manages and automates the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized applications across a cluster. It ensures that your apps are always running as desired.

It helps to automate tasks like:

  * __Deploying__ applications.
  * __Scaling__ them up or down.
  * __Managing__ their availability and health.
