# Argo ecosystem:

## ArgoCD

Tool for continuous delivery (CD) that helps you deploy and manage applications on Kubernetes. It ensures your applications are always in sync with your Git repositories, automatically updating your Kubernetes clusters when changes are made in the Git repo. You can think of it as a "GitOps" tool that connects your code repository to your Kubernetes environment for smooth deployment.

### Installing Argo-CD:

__Prerequisites:__

  1. __Kubernetes Cluster:__ Argo CD requires a running Kubernetes cluster.
  2. __kubectl:__ The Kubernetes command-line tool (kubectl).
  3. __Helm__

__Install:__

Add the Argo CD Helm repository

          helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
          helm repo update

Install Argo CD: 

          helm install argocd argo/argo-cd --namespace argocd --create-namespace

__Access Argo CD:__

access the Argo CD web UI via the service's URL.

Find the password: The initial admin password is auto-generated by Argo CD and stored as a Kubernetes secret.

          kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d

Access the UI: If you're using a LoadBalancer, get the external IP:

          kubectl get svc -n argocd

          https://<EXTERNAL-IP>

## Argo Workflows:

Allows to define, schedule, and manage complex workflows in Kubernetes. You can use it to automate processes that involve multiple steps, like running jobs or orchestrating data pipelines.

## Argo Events:

This tool handles event-driven automation. It helps trigger workflows or actions based on external events (like file uploads, HTTP requests, etc.).

## Argo Rollouts:

It manages canary deployments and blue-green deployments on Kubernetes. It lets you gradually release new versions of applications, monitor their performance, and roll back if needed.

## Argo CD Notifications:

This tool helps you set up notifications for various ArgoCD events, such as when an application is synced or when an error occurs, so you're always informed about what's happening.
