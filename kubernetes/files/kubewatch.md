A simple tool that watches your Kubernetes resources (like Pods, Deployments, Services, etc.) and sends notifications whenever something changes. For example, if a new Pod is created, a Deployment is updated, or a Service is deleted, Kubewatch can notify you via Slack, Email, or other notification channels.

In simple words, Kubewatch is like a "watchdog" for your Kubernetes cluster. It helps you keep track of changes to your resources by sending you alerts in real time.

__Use Cases:__

  * __Real-time Notifications:__ Get alerts when there are changes to your Kubernetes resources.
  * __Monitoring:__ Helps you monitor whatâ€™s happening in your cluster without constantly checking manually.
  * __Integration with Messaging Tools:__ Easily integrates with messaging platforms like Slack, making it easy to receive alerts.
