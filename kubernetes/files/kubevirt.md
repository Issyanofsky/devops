</div>

An extension for Kubernetes that allows you to run virtual machines (VMs) alongside your containerized applications. It brings the power of virtualization into Kubernetes, making it possible to manage both containers and VMs using the same Kubernetes platform.

Lets you run traditional virtual machines (like those you’d run on VMware or VirtualBox) in a Kubernetes environment. This allows you to manage both containers (small, fast apps) and VMs (larger, often more complex applications) in one place.

## Use cases:

  * __Unified Management:__ Manage VMs and containers in one system (Kubernetes).
  * __Hybrid Applications:__ Run legacy apps (that need VMs) and modern apps (that run in containers) together.
  * __Improved Infrastructure Efficiency:__ Take advantage of Kubernetes’ scheduling, scaling, and management features for VMs.
