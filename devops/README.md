|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|                  | - independent workflow             | - easy to implement (not many parts)|
|                  | - fast to scale - easy upgrade.    | - minimum number of hops (all in one|         
|    Advantages    | - play and play                    |   long code).                       |
|                  | - Fault tolerance - stability.     | - DRY - simple deployment.          |
|                  | - increase Agility                 |                                     | 
|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|                  | - complexity.                      | - spagetti code - long and complex  |
|                  | - operation Overheads - can have   |   code                              |
|  DisAdvantage    |   overlaping code.                 | - hard to trubelshoot and debug.    |
|                  | - hard to trubleshoot.             |                                     |
