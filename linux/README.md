# BOOT processes

## Boot processes:
  
  - BIOS - firmware that is built into a computer's motherboard. It is a low-level software responsible for initializing and testing hardware components during the booting process, and it provides an interface between the operating system and the hardware.
  - Bootloader - load the Kernel to memory and start it.
  - kernel - intermediary between the hardware and the software, managing system resources such as the CPU, memory, disk space, and peripheral devices. It essentially controls how the software and hardware communicate.
  - Init - the first process that runs when a Unix-like operating system (like Linux or macOS) boots up. It is the ancestor of all other processes, and its primary responsibility is to initialize the system by starting other essential system services and processes required for the system to function properly.

## SysVinit (Traditional init)

Runlevels: SysVinit uses runlevels (0-6) to define different states of the system:

 - 0: Halt
 - 1: Single-user mode (for maintenance)
 - 2: Multi-user mode (without network)
 - 3: Multi-user mode with network
 - 4: Unused or custom
 - 5: Multi-user mode with graphical interface
 - 6: Reboot

   (init 3) - Switch to runlevel 3 (multi-user mode with network).

## upstart

  (until version 15.04, when it was replaced by systemd).

## systemd

  Commands for Managing Services with systemd

    sudo systemctl start <service_name>
    sudo systemctl stop <service_name>
    sudo systemctl restart <service_name>
    sudo systemctl status <service_name>
    sudo systemctl list-units --type=service

## top

  top -  desplay real-time information about the systemâ€™s processes, CPU usage, memory usage, and other performance-related statistics.

## lsof 

  lsof  - (List Open Files) command in Linux and Unix-like operating systems is a utility used to display information about files that are currently open by processes.

## Processes 

  Processes - A process is an independent program that is running in its own memory space. 
  
## process thread

  thread - A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process (like sub process). 
  
## ps

  ps - (process status) command in Linux and Unix-like operating systems is used to display information about the currently running processes.

  (ps -u $USER) - show Processes for the Current User.
