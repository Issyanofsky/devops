## Protocol 

  Protocol - like a language or set of instructions that devices follow to communicate.

# Network Class

  Network Class - refers to a way of categorizing IP addresses based on their range. The classification helps determine how an IP address is used in terms of the size of the network and the number of devices it can accommodate.

  There are five main classes of IP addresses (A, B, C, D, and E), but most networks use only Classes A, B, and C:

    - Class A: Large networks, many hosts.
    - Class B: Medium-sized networks, fewer hosts.
    - Class C: Small networks, few hosts.
    - Class D: Multicast addresses (group communication).
    - Class E: Reserved for future use.
