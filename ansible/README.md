Ansible is a tool used for automating tasks like setting up servers, configuring software, and managing infrastructure.

## Key Points:

  1. __Configuration Management:__ It helps automate the setup and management of servers (like installing software, updating settings, etc.).
  2. __Simple Syntax:__ Uses a simple language (YAML) to define tasks. These tasks are written in playbooks.
  3. __Agentless:__ You don’t need to install anything on the target servers. It uses SSH to communicate with them.
  4. __Idempotent:__ It ensures that running the same tasks multiple times won’t cause issues (i.e., the system will only change if needed).
  5. __Scalable:__ You can manage one server or thousands with the same tool.

__*__ on the free version - it doesnt have a Database.

__*IMPORTANT__ only work on Linux. Ansible must be deploy on a Linux base server.
