# **Git**

</div>

## clone
  git clone https:/...<repository address> 
  sync folder (local) to the git repository

## add
  git add . 
  add files (and folders) to be sync to the trpository

## status
  git status
  show files (folder) that witing to be sync.

## commit
  git commit -m "<some text>"
  commit the changes to git with a description

## push
  git push 
  git push - u origin <branch name> - push the files to a specific branch

## merge
  git merge <branch> <second branch>
  merge branches

## pull
  git pull origin <branch-name>
  pull to the folder (local) from a specific branch

# branches
  git branch - display a list of all branches in the repository, with an asterisk (*) next to the currently active branch.
  
  git branch -a - lists all branches in the Git repository, both local and remote. 
  
  git branch <branch-Name> - create branch
  
  git checkout <branch-Name> - switch branches.
  
  git switch <branch_Name> - switch branches (like checkout - new command).
  
  git diff - show the differences between files in your working directory, staged changes, or between commits.

  git branch -f <brance_Name> HEAD~2 - change the branch's reference to a different commit without creating a new branch.

# HEAD

  where you currently are in your repository history.
  
  git checkout HEAD~1 - The parent commit of the current commit.

    (git diff HEAD~1 HEAD)
  
    (git reset --hard HEAD~1) - Reset HEAD (undo the last commit).

    (git reset --soft HEAD~1) - keep changes in your working directory but move HEAD to an earlier commit.

## reset

  git reset --soft/hard/mixed HEAD~2 - undo changes by moving the current HEAD (and possibly the index and working directory) to a specific state.

## revert

  git revert <commit_hash> - undo changes without disrupting others.
  
## cherry-pick

  git cherry-pick <commit_hash> - merging commit (or range of commit) from one branch to another (add it as a new commit).

## rebase

 main has new commits that you donâ€™t have in your feature-xyz branch, and you want to update your branch with those changes.
 
  git rebase main 

  (git rebase -i HEAD~5) - Clean Up Commit History

## log

  git log - view the commit history of a Git repository.
  

# GitHub CI

  method - testing, security, build images (packaging). all kind of test and packaging of the code.

  after passing the CI phase the process can continue to the CD stage (production).

  ## GitHub Action 

    allows you to automate workflows like testing, building, and deploying your code directly from a GitHub repository.

    location: .github/workflows 

    type: YAML file type.

    ## Workflow syntax and structure

      [YAML]
      name: workflow name (optional).
      on: the event that trigger the workflow (push, pull...)
      jobs: a list of jobs running
      steps: a list of steps within the job.

      ## example 

      name: Python CI
      
      on:
        push:
          branches:
            - main  # Trigger the action when there is a push to the `main` branch
          pull_request:
            branches:
            - main  # Trigger when a pull request is made to the `main` branch

    jobs:
      test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use the latest Ubuntu image for the runner

        steps:
        #Step 1: Checkout the code from the repository
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v2

        #Step 2: Set up Python
          - name: Set up Python
            uses: actions/setup-python@v2
            with:
              python-version: '3.8'  # Set Python version

        #Step 3: Install dependencies
          - name: Install dependencies
            run: |
              python -m pip install --upgrade pip
              pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`

        #Step 4: Run tests
          - name: Run tests
            run: |
            pytest  # Run your tests using pytest or any other test framework

## Triggers and Events

  events or actions that cause a workflow to run.

  - push - Runs when a commit is pushed to a branch.
  - pull_request - Runs when a pull request is created, synchronized, or reopened.
  - workflow_dispatch - Allows you to manually trigger a workflow.
  - schedule - Runs workflows on a schedule (similar to a cron job).
  - release - Runs when a release is published, created, or deleted.
  - create - Runs when a new branch or tag is created.
  
## jobs & Runners

  Runner - the environment (or machine) where the jobs run.

    jobs:
      test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # This job runs on a GitHub-hosted runner with Ubuntu

  Jobs - set of steps that execute as part of a workflow.

    jobs:
      test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # The job runs on a GitHub-hosted runner with Ubuntu
        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v2  # Step 1: Checkout the code
          - name: Install dependencies
            run: |
              python -m pip install --upgrade pip
              pip install -r requirements.txt  # Step 2: Install dependencies
          - name: Run tests
            run: pytest  # Step 3: Run tests using pytest

## need

  used to control the order in which jobs run within a workflow. It allows you to specify dependencies between jobs, meaning that one job should only run after another job has successfully completed.

  refer to another job in the workflow (will execute only if another job as accomplished).

## step & Actions

  steps - a single task that is part of a job in a GitHub Actions workflow. 

  Action -  reusable block of code or a pre-built functionality that can be used within a step. 
    
    -  uses: actions/checkout@v2  # This uses a GitHub-hosted action to check out the repository code.
    -  uses: actions/setup-python@v2  # This uses a GitHub-hosted action to set up a Python environment.
    -  uses: actions/github-script@v5  # This uses a GitHub-hosted action to run a custom script.
