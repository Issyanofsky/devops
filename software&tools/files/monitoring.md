# **Monitoring**

__Monitoring__ means keeping an eye on the health, performance, and reliability of applications, systems, and infrastructure. It involves collecting data on things like server uptime, response times, error rates, and resource usage, and then using that data to identify and fix problems before they affect users.

__monitoring on:__

  * Monitor Applications.
  * infrastructure (switch, firewall, servers.....).
  * cloud.

__* IMPORTANT__ not metrics system. it collect logs from the system.

__logs Levels:__

  1. __Fatal__ A fatal log level indicates a very serious issue that causes the application to crash or stop running. This is typically a critical error that prevents the system from continuing (Example: "System out of memory, shutting down.").
  2. __Error__ An error log level represents a significant issue or failure in the application that doesn’t necessarily stop the program but indicates something went wrong and needs attention (Example: "Database connection failed.").
  3. __Warn (warning)__ A warn log level indicates a potential problem or unexpected behavior, but it’s not severe enough to stop the application. It’s a cautionary message (Example: "Disk space is running low.").
  4. __Info (Information)__ An info log level provides general, informative messages about the system’s normal operations. It’s useful for tracking the flow of the application and understanding its behavior during normal execution (Example: "User logged in successfully.").
  5. __Debug__  A debug log level is used for detailed diagnostic messages that help developers understand the inner workings of the application. It’s typically used during development or troubleshooting (Example: "Initializing database connection, query parameters: {id=123}").
  6. __Trace__ A trace log level provides the most granular level of logging, showing every step or action the application is taking, often with very detailed information. It’s used for deep debugging or tracking issues in very complex scenarios (Example: "Entering method: fetchData() → parameters: {id=123}").

__* NOTICE__by setting each level include all levels bellow (e.g setting to INFO log level will include Warn, Error and Fatal too).

## stdout (containers)

In containers, Standard Output (often abbreviated as stdout) refers to the default stream where applications or services running inside the container send their output, such as logs, messages, and other information.

__Containers and Logs:__

  * In containers, logs generated by an application are often sent to stdout and stderr (Standard Error), which are both streams in Unix-based systems.
  * Logs written to stdout are usually accessible using container management tools like Docker or Kubernetes.
  * When you run a container, you can view its logs (stdout and stderr) by using commands like:

        docker logs <container_id> (for Docker)
        kubectl logs <pod_name> (for Kubernetes)

# **Syslogs**

</div>

Syslogs (short for System Logs) are a standard for message logging used in many computer systems, including Linux, UNIX, and other operating systems. Syslog is used to record messages from various system processes, services, applications, and hardware devices. These messages can provide valuable information for monitoring system performance, diagnosing issues, and ensuring system security.

__* IMPORTANT__ 
   
   - syslog server is a centerize sever that collect all logs ( it doesnt retrive logs. it need to be fetch logs from the targets).
   - use UDP (can cose consinstency problems. UDP not garente reciving all logs).
