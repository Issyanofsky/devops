Terragrunt is a tool that works with Terraform to make managing infrastructure easier. It helps organize and simplify the use of Terraform configurations, especially when you have multiple environments (like dev, staging, and production).

Terragrunt automates tasks like setting variables, handling state files, and working with modules, making it less repetitive and reducing errors. It helps you keep your Terraform code clean and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
