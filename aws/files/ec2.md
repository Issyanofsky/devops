# **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

</div>

virtual computers (called instances) to run your applications, websites, or services.

__Key Points:__

  * Virtual Machines: EC2 provides virtual servers that you can use to run any software, just like a physical server, but with more flexibility.
  * Scalable: You can easily increase or decrease the number of instances based on your needs (e.g., handle more traffic or reduce costs).
  * Pay-as-you-go: You only pay for the computing power you use, and you can stop or start instances whenever you need.
  * Customizable: You can choose the size, operating system, and configuration of your EC2 instance based on your needs.

__AMI__ - Amazon Machine Image. Image run on the EC2 (e.g. Ununtu).
__region__ - each EC2 deploy in a specific region.

## EC2 instances types:

  * __On-Demand Instances (Regular Instances):__ the most flexible EC2 instances. You pay by the hour or second, depending on the instance type.
  * __Reserved Instances:__ You reserve an EC2 instance for a 1 or 3 year term in exchange for a significant discount compared to on-demand prices.
  * __Savings Plans:__ A flexible way to save money on EC2 usage. You commit to a certain amount of usage (in dollars) per hour for 1 or 3 years.
  * __Spot Instances:__  You can bid for unused EC2 capacity at a lower price. The catch is that AWS can terminate the instance with little notice if they need the capacity back.
