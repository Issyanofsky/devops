  * IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): You get hardware resources (ex. AWS EC2).
  * PaaS (Platform as a Service): You get a platform to build and run apps (ex. Google App Engine).
  * SaaS (Software as a Service): You get a complete software application ready to use (ex. Microsoft 365).

__Types of clouds:__

  * Private Cloud: A cloud environment dedicated to a single organization.
  * Hybrid Cloud: A combination of private and public clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
  * Community Cloud: A cloud shared by a group of organizations with similar goals or security requirements. Itâ€™s like a private cloud but for a community of users.
  * Public Cloud: A cloud that is open to everyone, and resources are shared among multiple users. You use it over the internet.

## Availability Zones (AZ)

one or more data centers within a region (e.g., us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c).

## edge location

data centers designed to deliver content (like websites or videos) faster to users by caching content closer to them (e.g. AWS CloudFront uses Edge Locations to cache content for quicker access worldwide).
